## Introduction

In the financial sector, understanding credit risk is crucial. This project aims to improve credit risk models using various machine learning techniques. By employing models like XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, we tackle the challenges of predicting credit risk effectively.

## Project Overview

The repository contains a comprehensive implementation of credit risk modeling. It focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We utilize several machine learning algorithms to find the best solution for predicting credit risk. 

The primary objective is to minimize false positives and negatives in credit risk assessment. This will help financial institutions make better lending decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **XGBoost**: For gradient boosting.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building neural networks.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **LIME**: For model interpretability.
- **SHAP**: For feature importance analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is essential for improving model performance. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the steps involved:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can enhance model performance.
3. **Normalization**: Scale features to a standard range.
4. **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format.

These steps ensure that the data is ready for training machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models

This project employs several machine learning algorithms, including:

### 1. Logistic Regression
A fundamental algorithm used for binary classification. It provides a baseline for model performance.

### 2. Random Forest Regression
An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

### 3. XGBoost Classifier
An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It often outperforms other models in classification tasks.

### 4. Neural Networks
Deep learning models that can capture complex patterns in data. We use Keras to build and train our neural network.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating model performance is crucial. We use several metrics:

- **AUC-ROC Score**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Precision and Recall**: Helps understand the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

These metrics guide us in selecting the best model for deployment.

## Results

After extensive training and evaluation, we achieved significant improvements in predicting credit risk. The models demonstrated high AUC-ROC scores and favorable confusion matrix results. 

The results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a clear understanding of model performance.
